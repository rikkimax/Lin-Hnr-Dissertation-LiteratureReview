## Assembly language programming, Graphics programming in C++
### Summary

A compiler converts source code into native assembly targetting the given CPU.
The assembly composes of (commonly):

- Data transfer instructions
- Arithmetic and logical instructions
- Control flow instructions

From this interaction between memory (RAM) and I/O (Input/Output) devices occurs.
Some CPU's use registers to store little bits of information temporarily. This allows operations to execute within the CPU without touching the stack or memory.

Programs that use GUI's in any form have what is known as an event loop or in the case of Windows a message loop. The message loop allows getting of events and processing them for a window while the program wishes to still run. This event loop can be optimized to be more performant by using inline assembly.
