## Fast Networking with Socket-Outsourcing in Hosted Virtual Machine Environments
### Summary
Virtualization is a key tool in service hosting today. As part of this the virtualization stack that handles 
sockets and along with IP protocol is duplicated once in the host and second in the guest.

Variations of this system include by passing the host IP stack and push it into the guests and using the host 
to do the IP processing and routing it to the appropriete socket handle in the guest.

These variations are do-able for the the hosted type of virtual machines. Hosted VMs are where by the guest 
does have a full kernel and userspace supplied and instead rely on the hosts support. This is similar to the 
later container designs.

The hosted VM approach has significant benefits over paravirtualization and other full stack approaches as it 
limits the overhead in copying of the packets in and out.

### Conclusion
The approach that is socket-outsourcing in this paper has shown that full stack and other virtualization 
techniques such as containers are not optimal when it comes to socket communications. They include 
significant overhead in the copying of packets during processing and in some cases have the packet processed 
multiple times during routing by the kernel of the host and guest.
