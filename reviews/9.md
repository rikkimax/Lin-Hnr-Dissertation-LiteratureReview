## Engineering a Simple, Efficient Code Generator Generator
### Summary
Presents a way to generate assembly by parsing out a tree graph by utilising compile time generation of code.
It utilises a syntax in the same family that BEG, Twig and PEG live in. The focus of the rule is to seperate 
tokens within the tree to the generation rules.

Each leaf of the tree contains a weight in the form of cost. This cost computates and is part of the choosing 
process to decide which instruction must the one being used.

It is not capable of computing cost of sets of instructions that require different cost estimations such as 
the case of assigning a register to 0, having a cost of 0 as a whole statement.

The tree graph that the burg alogirthm utilises must be generated and passed into.

### Conclusion
Presents a compile time generation of assembly generation by parsing out a tree graph into code that prefers 
least cost of input parsing as part of the generation process.
This is an interesting introduction to assembly generator generators. Other code generators focus upon 
parsing out text into an AST tree. Where as this focuses upon generatoring assembly from already parsed AST.
