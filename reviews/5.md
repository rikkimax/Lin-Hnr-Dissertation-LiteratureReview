## Server-centric Web frameworks: an overview
### Summary
Web service frameworks have been described as being in one of two camps, server centric and client centric. Server being the majority in existence.

The below is a list of functional requirements for a web framework:
- Form handling
- Validation
- Session management
- Security
- Event handling
- Concurrency
    Thread safety
- Resource usage
    - File descriptors
    - Sockets
    - Memory
    - Processes

On top of this resource generation to be returned by the framework can be in the forms:
- Markup emitted by code, quite commonly referred to as spaghetti code
- Using abstractions within code to export the end resource
- Code within ghe markup itself

### Conclusion
This research paper provides a background into how to analyse web frameworks and its ilk. It gives a good categorisation for requirements of them and how to classify them.
