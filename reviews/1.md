## Elementary Data Structures, Introduction to algorithms third edition
### Summary
Elementary data structures are usage of memory to represent data in some basic forms such as trees, sets and lists.
The data structures discussed in this chapter are:

1. Stacks and queues
2. Linked lists
3. Rooted trees with unbounded branching

For each of these data structures, the adding and removing primitives are discussed along with indexing by using pseudo code that can be implemented in almost any language as long as some form of pointers can be used.
A graphical representation is presented for reach primitive with reguards to how it works and manipulates the given memory.

As part of the linked list discussion, information reguarding preventing the need for new allocations is also presented.
A novel approach is presented in rooted trees with unbounded branching to allow for linear allocation space as number of children increase for a single parent. Specifically by using a left-child, right-sibling representation in which a node will only ever know its parent, its sibling to the right and the left most child it has.

### Conclusion
The presented information is quite a useful and interesting representation of the elementary information for data structures. The presented images to graphically display the algorithms along with the psuedo code is quite effective in teach them. It is definately useful if quotes or drawings are needed to explain the basics of any presented data structure to be able to reference these in some form.
