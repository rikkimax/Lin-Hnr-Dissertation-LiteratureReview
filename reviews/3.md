## Thread scheduling, Windows internals fifth edition
### Summary

Threads are executed on cores that they are allowed to also known as "processor affinity". The default is any.
The decision of when which threads can be ran is using a priority-driven approach. The highest priority always runs.

A thread may execute for a 'quantum' unit. The actual length is dependent upon the system and the process.
The actual dependency is as follows:

1. System configuration, long or short quantums.
2. Foreground or background status of the process.
3. The thread job object.

The kernel does not have a set abstraction called the scheduler instead it is spread over many files and has these triggers (comes directly from the source):

- A thread becomes ready to execute.
  e.g. just been created or released from wait state
- A thread leaves the running state because its time quantum ends, it terminates, it yields execution or it enters a wait state.
- A thread's priority changes.
  e.g. system service call or Windows itself changes priority value
- A thread's processor affinity changes so that it will no longer run on the processor on which it was running.

At each point it decides which thread to next execute this is then performed by what is known as a context switch.
There is no consideration for thread vs process allocation of time.

A thread may have be of the state:

1. Ready, can be executed
2. Deferred ready, requires set processor but ready to execute on it
3. Standby, the next thread to execute on a specific processor
4. Running, currently being executed
5. Waiting, on hold for results from e.g. kernel or IO
6. Transition, the kernel stack is not in memory, once it is it will go into ready state
7. Terminated, the thread has finished executing but has yet been cleaned up within the kernel

Not described is gate waiting and initialized.

### Conclusion
In the above summary majority of this chapter was not summarised. It is a book on Windows kernel internals and is not of concern in the most part.
What is described is that a thread has a set of states and those states have set points that may alter them but when it should executable is fairly configurable.
