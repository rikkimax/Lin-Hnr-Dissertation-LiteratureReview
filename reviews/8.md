## Managing Routing Disruptions in Internet Service Provider Networks
### Summary
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are with new content such as VOIP and video games under more pressure with 
regards to bandwidth and other routing disruptions.

Problems that ISPs must contend with:
1. Indirect control over the flow of traffic, in other words they may not own or control in any form
2. Large reactions to small changes, network related protocols over react causing a snow ball affect
3. Slow routing protocol convergence, when routers change and reconfigure they are slow causing packet lost 
and slowness
4. Poor support for planned events, routing protocols cannot change themselves using ahead of time knowledge

Each router utilises a Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) such as OSPF and IS-IS. As part of this there are 
weights to each of the following routers which it utilises to decide which router to send a packet to.
On top of this the routing information exchanged between routing system uses the protocol Border Gateway 
Protocol (BGP) to exchange route paths and use this information to choose the paths taken by packets outside 
of its own network but within the given network.

ISPs utilise these different configuration protocols to enable high traffic path ways given different 
weightings to packet destinations. These are altered based upon hardware changes, network usage and 
alterations outside of the given network.

### Conclusion
The development of an interconnected network of routing mechanisms requires multiple ways of configuration. 
Using this, the protocols over correct for any events that occur within the network and others it connects 
to. The main mechanism internally to a router is the weights to each other router it connects to from which 
it pushes the packet out via.
