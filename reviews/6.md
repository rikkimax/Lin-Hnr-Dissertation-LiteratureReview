## AC: Composable Asynchronous IO for Native Languages
### Summary
Goal: to archive simple and easy to understand as concurrent as possible non threaded connections.

Designed as a proof of concept for languages such as c/c++.

Effectively rewrites how the mechanisms of thread sleeping occurs.

When connections block or sleep, they are then forwarded into the previous stack of blocked/sleeping state.

Parallelism is not shown or used. Instead a single threaded approach expanded upon. To disclose how to get as much time out of a thread at any point.

The demonstration given, shows that it is possible via modifications to c, to provide a continuation of activities whilst others are waiting.

The proof of concept was hooked into Windows to test upon how effective it was at reading files. It was highly efficient compared to other means.

### Conclusion
The research paper has shown an optimization technique that is capable of getting more performance out of operations by changing how the code is scheduled and then executed.
