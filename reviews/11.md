## Adaptive Overload Control for Busy Internet Servers
### Summary
This paper introduces a form of architecture as an alternative to other conventional forms such as per 
connection thread of fibers. Using a differentation of handlers to a given event and having a set of events 
sheduled to execute all together allowing for single blocking actions instead of multiple blocks on seperate 
threads.

On top of this the handlers include a controller which determines weather that set of implementation can 
process that event. The specific conditions that the specific controller implement can be class based or 
load based. This allows for degredation of service for some but not all of users by scheduling events 
differently.

### Conclusion
Introduces a different way to schedule tasks based upon if they can block or not and given the current 
environmental conditions. This approach is seperate to that of event based or one thread per connection and 
provides a predictable degradation of the end service.
