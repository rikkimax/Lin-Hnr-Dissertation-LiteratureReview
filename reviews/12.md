## Modeling Request Routing in Web Applications
### Summary
The main purpose of this paper is to instigate a way in a web router that utilises controllers exposed in the 
URI to explain the process by which it has been altered when using a pipeline approach the event handling.

As part of this it uses an auto generated exportation from the route handler usages in the end web pages to 
describe all possible routes by scanning links referenced. From this a state machine in the Z format is 
created. It is possible to execute this Z format using an emalating enabling testing of which handler 
actually got a specific URI and with what arguments.

The above explanation of the routing mechanism is used as a way to bring a 35kLOC (Lines Of Code) web service 
into a more managable explanation of how it is operating.

### Conclusion
Primarily this paper has introduced the idea that in any routing library that exportation of routing order 
and processing for a specific URI is crucial to understanding them. Web applications are simply to large of 
an application without documetnation as to actually how it is operating to be able to maintain it.
