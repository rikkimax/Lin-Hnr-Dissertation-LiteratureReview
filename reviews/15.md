## Optimizing Web servers using Page rank prefetching for clustered accesses
### Summary

At the core of this paper introduces the idea of prefetching content based upon the page rank of each content 
it accesses. This prefetching can be done at client side, server side and proxy in front of the server.

This is used within groups of contents that is usually requested together. The page rank algorithm along with 
determining what should be prefetched is exeucted every request requiring it to be efficient.

It can be extended to support user interactions and patterns to further optimize which content should be 
prefetched.

### Conclusion
The content that is available based upon a single request can significantly improve the performance for 
loading a single webpage. Which is what HTTP/2.0 is based upon.
