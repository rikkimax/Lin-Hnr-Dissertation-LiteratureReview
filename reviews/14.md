## Distributed cooperative Web servers
### Summary

There are plenty of existing methods of distributing requests between a set of servers. From using a load 
balencer to DNS based upon locations.
In this paper they describe using dynamic rewriting of servers into the page content itself to load balence 
by isolating certain content to specific servers for the requests but not in storage.

The dynamic rewriter is aware of content hits as well as server load in total. Based upon this it alters 
which server it utilises for that content.

Below is the algorithm used for deciding which server to migrate content to.

```
Input:
Given a local document graph of a home server, and a
threshold of load.
Output:
This algorithm selects a document to be migrated to a coop
server.
(i) Let the candidate document set be a set of all the
documents in the graph.
(ii) Remove all the wellknown entry points from . If is empty,
return .
(iii) Remove documents from if their load (i.e., value in
the tuple) is less than the threshold value . If is empty,
reset it to the previous set and repeat this step with reduced
value of until becomes nonempty.
(iv) Select a document (or more) pointed to by a minimal number
of documents that do not reside on the home
server.
(v) If two or more documents are selected in step (iv), pick one
that point
```

### Conclusion
As presented in the paper, dynamic rewriting of links within content can be used to isolate content to a 
specific server and by doing so allowing for similar content or highly referenced to be served by the same 
server. In doing so it can be used to server larger web sites far in higher capacity.
