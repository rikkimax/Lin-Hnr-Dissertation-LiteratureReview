## Fast request routing using regular expressions
### Summary
The author of the article has read a router engine code and based upon this determined that perhaps it was 
not optimizing the correct parts of the routing process. Because of this the author Nikita developed and 
benchmarked their own one against it.

The original router engine Pux, uses Regex to decide which route to map with an extension written in C which 
is optional. The routing library that Nikita developed does not include an extension. However it was faster 
in all but for the first route.

In short the requirements of the routing problem is (from the article):

Storing:
```php
$r->addRoute('GET', '/user/{name}/{id:\d+}', 'handler0');
$r->addRoute('GET', '/user/{id:\d+}', 'handler1');
$r->addRoute('GET', '/user/{name}', 'handler2');
```

Routing:
```php
$d->dispatch('GET', '/user/nikic/42');
// => provides 'handler0' and ['name' => 'nikic', 'id' => '42']
```

As stated the slowest part of the process is the iteration of the list of routes and check if it is that 
route for each one.

The approach taken inside the library written by the authror is to combine all the routing rules into one 
single one.

Indevidual:
```
    ~^/user/([^/]+)/(\d+)$~
    ~^/user/(\d+)$~
    ~^/user/([^/]+)$~
```

Combined:
```
   ~^(?:
        /user/([^/]+)/(\d+)
      | /user/(\d+)
      | /user/([^/]+)
    )$~x
```

Which makes one check instead of a possible significant number of iterations.

### Conclusion
The author of the source article demonstrated and exemplified statement 'what you optimize matters more than 
how it is optimized'. By changing the representation of the route checker functions, changes the speed that 
which it can be iterated and applied.
