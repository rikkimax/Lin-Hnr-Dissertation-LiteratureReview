## Multithreaded Applications, Introduction to algorithms third edition
### Summary
Most algorithms atleast those presented in the book, are designed to work in a single thread environment. This means that memory can only be accessed and manipulated from one thread at any given point in time.

Coroutines are introduced in the format of "spawning" a thread to execute a procedure upon. Where by the original thread is capable of moving on and then getting the result when that other thread is done working. This is commonly used in asynchronous libraries.

A good quote describing scheduling providing in the chapter is:
"Good performance depends on more than just minimizing the work and span. The strands must also be scheduled efficiently onto the processors of the parallel machine." page 781, scheduling sub heading.
This is important because there are limited resources to execute a thread on the cpu and switching threads are costly. After all, not all work needs to execute continuously and does indeed have to wait for other information.

Race conditions are introduced as a problematic situation that can occur should a thread depend on a global state and then changes it. Otherwise known as a determinacy race.

Multithreaded matrix opterations are mentioned last, however a review is not included as it is meant as an application of the previous knowledge.

### Conclusion
Simple concurrency is presented in the form of coroutines. Messaging passing and global state is mentioned but not recommeneded. Problematic situations are also brought to light in the form of determinacy races. Other race conditions such as waiting for a mutex lock are not mentioned.
Along with discussion of the problems and theory, psuedo code changes to existing algorithms are presented for ones like Fibonacci so that it may execute in parallel to itself.
