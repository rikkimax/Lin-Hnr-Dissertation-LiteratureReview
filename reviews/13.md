## Architecture of a Web server accelerator
### Summary

Static content served by web servers can be slow to access for normal web servers to decrease the time it 
takes to fill the requests for a webpage an accelerator goes in fron of a normal server which caches the 
results of static content and serves it to the client instead.

In the paper they utilise an "embedded" operating system which has a smaller TCP/IP stack which minimizes 
copying of requests and responses. For the accelerator provided, it allows an external program via an API to 
invalidate and add cached pages to its cache at any time. Allowing for both dynamic and static content to be 
contained.

The accelerator goes in front of any load balencing, if it has content for the request in its cache it will 
serve it. Otherwise a redirect is provided to the client which directs it to the webserver load balencer or 
web server in question.

### Conclusion
This paper has shown that by all means the TCP/IP stack and along with it how it is manipulated can greatly 
increase the speed for even dynamic content as long as the entire stack is designed for it.
